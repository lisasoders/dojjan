On my e-commerce, Dojjan, I sell shoes. The idea has always been to have a fairly clean design that should catch the customer's attention. I have deliberately chosen not to have so many products.

The idea is that on the start page you should get a small insight into what kind of shoes there are. Then you click on the product page and place an order for what you want.

The pages are "simple" and it is clear what to do to place an order.

The code is clearly commented so you know what each part does.
